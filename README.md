Form Submission with Email Receiver is a web-based application that allows users to submit a form, and the submitted data is sent to a specified email address. Built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a server-side scripting language like PHP, the application provides a form for users to input their information. Upon submission, JavaScript handles client-side validation to ensure data accuracy, and the form data is sent to the server. The server-side script processes the data and sends it via email to the designated recipient using SMTP or a similar protocol. This application is useful for collecting user feedback, inquiries, or registrations and forwarding them to the appropriate email address for further action.
